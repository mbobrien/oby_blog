Ok, so, this is a first passage which just has a bunch of text but which is also meant to show the use of footnotes.[^fn3] And I don't think this will be super special but definitely keen to see how it does look, especially given the amount of referencing I like to capture.[^fn2]

And this is more text with lots of blah blah but also has a second footnote that is worth noting.[^fn1]

Frankly, I'm just gonna say it...  I think it looks pretty damn slick! Very impressive!
