This space focuses on the importance and relevance of philosophy to everyday life. It brings philosophy out of the academic fortress and makes it real and relevant for regular people. I am not an academic theoriser. I am a seasoned leader, technologist, ethicist, and culture-builder in the real world. I think that philosophy should be more than just obscure words and fanciful ideas. In my world, I want it to be real.
